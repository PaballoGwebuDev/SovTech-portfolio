## About me

> Three words: Curious, Creative and Unstopabble.

That's who I have grown to become. I love acquiring knowledge and learning new skills, so that I might apply those learnings to create efficient and sustainable solutions within our increasingly digital world. Once I commit to a problem, I go all out and make sure I find a solution, No matter the challenges or setbacks. I want to work at SolveTech because it is an opportunity for me to grow my business and technical skillset, so that I might make a positive impact in the industry I am passionate about.
